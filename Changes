0.91    2010-05-05 22:55
------------------------
- Much better parsing of VPM-CPL and VPM-XML files.
- Addition of vpmcpl() and vpmxml() methods to return respective data.
- Update documentation, particularly around the sections that can
  retrieved directly (e.g. "Licensing Statistics" and many
  others).
- Better unit testing.
- Updated example script now includes date/time of the sysinfo.

0.92    2010-05-06
------------------------
- Added more author-only unit tests.  Now up to 5,730 tests.

0.93    2010-09-01
------------------------
- Added more author-only tests.

0.94    2010-10-10
------------------------
- Refactored into BlueCoat::SGOS

0.95    2011-11-11
------------------------
- Removed support and tests for SGOS 4.x.
- Added a new get_sysinfo_from_data method to parse sysinfo that
  already exists in a data structure.
- Added an internal-only function to parse the last hardware
  and software reboot times.
- Parsing of the uptime is now also returned in seconds since
  the epoch.

1.00    2012-02-28
------------------------
- Updated methods to capture sysinfo data.  It is no longer necessary
  to connect to the Blue Coat ProxySG to retrieve the realm name to
  pass back to the LWP::UserAgent constructor.  Instead, the username
  and password are passed directly to the initial connection to the
  device.  This saves a round trip to the device.
- Added a new method to send commands to the ProxySG.  It is name
  send_command and takes a scalar containing commands to be run
  on the ProxySG.
- Updated the module to no longer automatically parse the sysinfo file.
  This is necessary if you only want the sysinfo file.
- Added a capture.pl example script to the examples directory.  This script
  takes the sysinfo from a remote device and saves in on the local
  filesystem with a timestamp.
- Updated copyright.

1.01    2012-07-09 19:22
------------------------
- Added the ability to use Build.PL to install the distribution, to be
  more friendly for non-Unix systems.
- Updated copyright to be GPL v2 only.
- Testing is now more aggressive.

1.02    2012-07-15 20:21
------------------------
- Updated documentation for send_command.  You're already in configuration mode,
  so it's not necessary to use 'conf t' before running commands.
- Updated prerequisite build modules (Test::NoWarnings).

1.03    2012-07-19 22:22
------------------------
- Standardized test suites, using -T where possible.

1.04    2013-03-16 18:02
------------------------
- Updated copyright.
- Updated interface parsing to be less noisy.
- Renamed test files.

1.05    2013-03-18 18:02
------------------------
- Squashed bug 78469: fix returns with undef.
- Squashed bug 78470: fix file open issues.
- Squashed bug 78418: fix licensing in makefiles.
- Changed tests to use TEST_AUTHOR environment variable.

1.06    2015-11-20 20:00
------------------------
- Added get_section_list and get_section methods.  The old way of retrieving
  this data via variable ( $obj->{'sgos_sysinfo_sect'}{'Hardware Information'} )
  is deprecated.  You should now use the get_section method instead, like this:
  $obj->get_section('Hardware Information')
- Fixed copyright date.  Hello, 2015!
- Many author-only tests updated.  Many Perl::Critic tests added to facilitate
  better code.
- Changed the get_sysinfo() method to get_sysinfo_from_appliance() to be more
  consistent with the other methods.
- Moved code repository to GitHub
